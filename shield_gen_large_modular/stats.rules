/*
		Purple 90 On:
				ArcShield: inherits from Base (changes Operational, Shield effects and Hit effects).
				EmitterEffect: inherit from Base (changes Operational and Media effects).
				Overclock/Overload: inherits from Base (changes Radius, Arc and chained).
			Purple On Angles: inherit from Purple 90 On Components.
				ArcShield: from Purple 90 On (changes Rotation, Radius and Arc).
				EmitterEffect: through component.
				Overclock/Overload: from Purple 90 On (changes Radius, Arc and chained).
			Colors 90 On: inherits from Purple 90 On Components.
				ArcShield: from Purple 90 On (changes Shield effects and Hit effects).
				EmitterEffect: from Purple 90 On (changes Media effects).
				Overclock/Overload: from Purple 90 On.
			Colors Angles On: inherits from Color 90 On Components.
				ArcShield: from Color 90 On (changes Rotation, Radius and Arc).
				EmitterEffect: from Color 90 On component.
				Overclock/Overload: from Purple On Angles.
			Everything Off:
				ArcShield: inherits from its On version (changes Shield effect and Hit effects).
				EmitterEffect: doesn't exist.
				Overclock/Overload: doesn't exist
			
			ShieldOperationEffects works as normal even though it is chained to ArcShield and uses IsOperationalProxy instead of these new shields (it doesn't appear it inherits from Components).
			
			The overclocking/overdrive parts work normally in the 90LeftArc and 90RightArc, no idea why but just in case I also put the code there as with the other arcs.
